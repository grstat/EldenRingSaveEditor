# EldenRingSaveEditor
A Save file editor for Elden Ring written in C#

## Note
Since the last update only the Steam ID changer works. You can take a save file from another
steam account and alter the ID to use on your account.

I began working on the stats alteration but I haven't had the time to get it to work properly.
However, you can view the stats of each character in the save file you load.

I'm posting up the code in case anyone else wants to do work on this or use it as a reference for
your own project.
